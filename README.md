# EV_Preference_MachineLearning
Electric Vehicles (EV) in the United States are mostly owned by multi-vehicle households (that own both EVs and gasoline vehicles). It is important to understand EV preference in these households to fully realize the green house gas reduction potential of EVs. In this project, a modeling framework was developed, leveraging the combination of K-modes clustering and decision trees, to identify the category/cluster of trips for which EVs are preferred (over gasoline vehicles) in these households. The effects of socio-demographic and economic factors on EV preference was also captured by the modelling framework. 

All the models in the project were coded from scratch (using Numpy and Pandas). Here is a visual representation of the 2-step modeling framework.
